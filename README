What: 
Magento extension (tested with 1.4* and 1.5* series) 

Why: 
You need this when you have paypal_express enabled and you need to enable client registration. Currently paypal_express only
allows users to check out as authorised or guests and ignores Magento built in registration possibilities

How: 
it adds 2 listeners (before and after quote conversion to order) and listens if paypal_express payment method is used. 
If it's used it imports/sets user data to quote and customer object and sets the password (if not chosed by customer) to quote 
and sets the method back to register

extract this extension to your magento root

Usage:
